      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, welcome to my website! I am graduate of the MIT-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Biological Oceanography. During my PhD, I studied the biogeochemistry and ecophysiology of chemoautotrophic &lt;em&gt;Campylobacteria&lt;/em&gt; (prev. &lt;em&gt;Epsilonproteobacteria&lt;/em&gt;) under the guidance of Dr. Stefan Sievert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am working as a Postdoc at the University of Southern California with Dr. Jed Fuhrman. This position is part of a larger project funded by the Simons Foundation (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cbiomes.org&#34; title=&#34;CBIOMES Homepage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CBIOMES&lt;/a&gt;) to model the biogeochemistry of oceans on basin scales. I am contributing to this effort by generating new amplicon datasets from materials shared by collaborators using the Fuhrman Lab&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1462-2920.13023&#34; title=&#34;Link to Parada et al paper&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;universal (16S/18S) primers&lt;/a&gt;. Since the resulting data provide a comprehensive profile of the entire community, they can be used to better understand microbial biogeography and help contribute to model validation and development. During my time in the Fuhrman lab, I&amp;rsquo;ve also become interested in reproducible data analysis. My first foray into this area was to develop &lt;a href=&#34;https://fuhrman-lab.github.io/post/515y-926r-qiime2-pipeline/&#34; title=&#34;Fuhrman lab in-house pipeline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a simple pipeline for the 515Y/926R primers&lt;/a&gt;. When trying to apply the same kind of bash scripting to a more complex/less linear task, it quickly became too unweildy. This led me to buckle down and learn how to use the workflow management tool snakemake which is an incredibly powerful tool to build workflows to answer scientific questions that are not straightforward computationally (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jcmcnch/MGPrimerEval&#34; title=&#34;MGPrimerEval snakemake pipeline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;see for example my MGPrimerEval pipeline&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, it has conda support &amp;ldquo;baked in&amp;rdquo; so that sharing your pipeline with others should be relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before coming to USC, I worked for one year at the Chinese University of Hong Kong with Dr. Haiwei Luo where I focused mainly on microbial isolation and single-cell genomic analyses. Before my PhD, I worked with the National Research Council of Canada on algal biofuels research in Halifax, NS, Canada. I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology on Canada&amp;rsquo;s east coast at Mount Allison University in Sackville, NB and am originally from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. My hobbies include gardening, board games, spending time in the great outdoors, listening to great music (check my twitter for some #songsofcomfort apropos to this difficult time we are living through), playing around in linux systems, and fermenting things.&lt;/p&gt;
